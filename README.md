Unit 3 JavaScript Password Generator Homework

## Description
This project was to create a random password generator.  We were to use javaScript to add a series of prompt questions and confirms to create a unique password.  The password is customizable to the length, lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers and special characters.  Click on the "Generate Password" button in the middle of the screen to start the series of questions.

## Navigation
The web page has a box in the middle with a heading of Password Generator.  It has Generate Password in the body with the button to start the prompt boxes to start the generator.
